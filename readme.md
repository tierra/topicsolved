# phpBB Topic Solved Extension

Allows posting questions, and accepting answers as solved.

Solved indicators will be shown next to titles throughout forum and topic
views. Mostly ideal for support forums, but can be customized for marking
topics for other purposes such as classifieds being marked as sold.

This is an update of the phpBB 3.0.x Topic Solved MOD, written by Jari Kanerva.

## Install

You can install this extension in phpBB by following the steps below:

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/tierra/topicsolved/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded release, and change the name of the folder to
   `topicsolved`.
3. In the `ext` directory of your phpBB board, create a new directory named
   `tierra` (if it does not already exist).
4. Copy the `topicsolved` directory to `phpBB/ext/tierra/` (if done correctly,
   this readme file should be located at:
   `phpBB/ext/tierra/topicsolved/readme.md`).
5. Navigate in the ACP to `Customise -> Manage extensions`.
6. Look for `Topic Solved` under the Disabled Extensions list, and click its
   `Enable` link.

## Getting Started

After enabling the extension, you must configure each individual forum you
would like solved topic functionality to be enabled for. Under the "Forums"
section in the Administration Control Panel, find each forum you would like to
enable solved topics for, and click "Edit forum".

Topic Solved will not work for "Category" or "Link" type forums, it will only
work with "Forum" forum types. Once you have ensured your forum is set for the
"Forum" type, the topic solved settings will show up in it's own section near
the bottom of the settings form.

At the minimum, you must select either "Yes" or "Moderator" for the "Allow
topics to be marked as solved" setting in order to enable solved topics for the
forum you wish to use this extension with.

The remaining settings alter the behavior and permissions required to mark
topics as solved or unsolved, as well as the appearance of the indicator.

## Uninstall

1. Navigate in the ACP to `Customise -> Extension Management -> Extensions`.
2. Look for `Topic Solved` under the Enabled Extensions list, and click its
   `Disable` link.
3. To permanently uninstall, click `Delete Data` and then delete the
   `/ext/tierra/topicsolved` directory.

## Contributing

The primary release ZIP is not designed for local development. Consider forking
and cloning this repository with git in order to submit patches using git pull
requests. A convenient docker environment is provided that allows for testing
changes with a fresh installation of phpBB 3.1 and 3.2:

1. Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
2. Also install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
3. On OSX, install [dinghy](https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy).
4. On Linux, install [dory](https://github.com/FreedomBen/dory).

Now spin up the compose environment:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

If everything was installed correctly, you can open phpBB now:

*    phpBB 3.1: http://phpbb31.topicsolved.docker/
*    phpBB 3.2: http://phpbb32.topicsolved.docker/

Simply run through the normal phpBB installation procedures, and you should
find the Topic Solved extension available in the ACP customizations. For the
database, use "db" for the host, "root" for user, leave password blank, and use
"phpbb" for database. You will need to use different table prefixes for each
version of phpBB since they use the same database, like "bb31_" and "bb32_".

You will want to edit the phpBB config files in order to enable debug mode,
which allows you to leave the "install" directory in place while viewing the
board:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm phpbb31 bash
vim config.php # Enable @define('DEBUG', true);
```
